Patterson correlation refinement [44] was performed against 60\u201315-A resolution data to optimize the orientation (final correlation coefficient (cc) of 0.021 for cell 1 and 0.027 for cell 2). The position and orientation of the particle were then refined at 30A with the E1E1 target function [43] (cc = 0.196 for cell 1, 0.195 for cell 2), giving an initial set of non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators for the two cell types. P3 trimers inside the icosahedral asymmetric unit were refined at 6A resolution and NCS operators were re-refined at 8A resolution [43] (cc = 0.375 for cell 1, 0.546 for cell 2).

Boot-strap analyses were conducted with the same software program, employing a full heuristic search with 500 replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swap-ping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). The consensus of the bootstrap replicates was used to determine bootstrap values. The search strategy of the wood matrix was adjusted because of excessive computational time to run the analysis to completion. Therefore, MULTREES option was turned off, and a heuristic search using 1000 instead of 100 replicates was carried out.

The ranking of candidate EC genes as determined by each of these programmes is illustrated in Table 3.

Use of all three programmes confirmed that B2M and PPIA was the best combination of genes for normalising RQ-PCR data in CRC tissues (table 3).<geNorm>"
