Analysing the relative positions of methionine residues and predicted transmembrane helices (program TMHMM47) in all the candidate sequences from the virus showed that fragment I belonged to the N-terminal region of the 117-residue integral membrane protein P16, predicted to possess an 18-residue transmembrane helix between residues 7 and 24.

We determined the NR1–NR2A S1S2 structure by molecular replacement using a heterodimer search probe model built by superposing the structures of NR1 S1S2–glycine28 and NR2A S1S2–glutamate onto the GluR2 S1S2 dimer structure in helix J. Refinement was done with CNS46.

QBasePlus was used for calculation of PDCD4 expression relative to each of the  Amplification efficiencies for each EC gene assay were calculated applying the formula E = (10-1/slope - 1) × 100, using the slope of the plot of Ct versus log input of cDNA (10-fold dilution series).
